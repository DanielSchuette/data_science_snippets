    examples of how to use python for statistical simulation

    simulation is a way to model random events by repeatedly
    sampling from a probability distribution that is likely
    to underlie the actual real-life event

    usually, the workflow is as follows:
        1. define possible outcomes
        2. assign probabilities to outcomes
        3. define the relationship between outcomes/variables
        4. sample repeatedly from the appropriate probability
           distribution to simulate possible outcomes
        5. visualize/analyze outcomes
